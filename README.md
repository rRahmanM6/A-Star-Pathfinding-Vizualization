# A-Star-Pathfinding-Visualization
A python script that utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path between two points and visualizes each step of the process in a GUI. 

NOTE: The script uses the pygame package for the GUI aspect of the program.

HOW TO USE

After running the script, the first click will select the starting point (orange), and the second click will select the end point (turquoise). Any further clicks will create obstacles in the selected spots which the alogorithm will have to avoid. After drawing any desired obstacles, press the Space key to begin the search process.

After the algortihm finishes executing, the shortest path between the two nodes will be marked in green.
